                <p>
                    I started my journey as a Medical Science (1st class Hons.) graduate, and worked as a 
                    data entry assistant in medical oncology trails. I thought that there would be more 
                    I could do. Fast forward to 1.5 years later, I am learning new languages and building 
                    projects on my own, while studying my Computer Science degree at UTS.

                            The Honour's thesis focused on neuroinflammation, and its contribution in 
                            the progression of Parkinson's disease. It additionally explored the known
                            side effect of extensive Levodopa use in late stage Parkinson's disease. The 
                            significance of this study is to provide early insight into treating this outcome 
                            via a novel CB2 agonist and serving as a stepping stone to studies that are 
                            follow up on this pilot study.

                            Shortly after graduating from my Honour's, I worked as a data entry assistant in
                            oncology. The role focused on triaging, accurately entering, updating, and monitoring 
                            highly sensitive and confidential patient data into patient database system. I also 
                            played a significant role in creating a majority of the clinical trial trackers, which
                            led to the recovery of monies from old (a decade or more) clinical trials.

                            At the time, I was teaching for a unit called Mathematicas 2 (33230) to get some
                            additional money on the side, whilie honing my verbale and written communication.
                            For the majority of my time teaching, I ran some tutorial classes and workshops. 
                            I was primarily responsible for delivering the prescribed tutorial material to 
                            the students of the course. However, I was also invigilating some in class 
                            assessments to ensure that every student who was taking the course upheld university
                            integrity policies.

                            After realising that the Medical Science field was not something I would see myself
                            doing for the majority of my life, I made a commitment to switching into the tech 
                            field. Currently, I am in my second (in between second and third as I switched from 
                            USYD to UTS) year of my degree. The approaching semester, I will be doing DSA,

                            analysts do and the various different branches of cyber. In addition, I had an
                            introduction on how vulnerabilities are introduced and the impact it may have on a
                            network wide scope. To monitor these things, there were tools used to analyse codebases
                            to remediate these vulnerabilities before they public facing which prevents things like
                            Cross site scripting, SQL injection, XML injection, etc. This role was highly beneficial,
                            as it gave me a network of people and some exposure to the different flavours of 
                            cybersecurity.
